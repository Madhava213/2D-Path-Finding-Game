# 2D Path Finding Game

## Description
A 2D game with green circle nodes and brown square obstacles. The player can press 'R' or use the UI button in the game to reset the level (second 2 in video), press 'E' to spawn an obstacle at the origin. The user can also drag the obstacle around. The game will automatically regenerate the path which has no collision with any obstacles (second 3 in video). The player then can left click on any nodes for the start node and right click for the end node. The agent will move along the path from start to end (second 7 in video). If the player moves the obstacle to collide with the path, the game will automatically generate new path and the agent can follow the new path (second 11 in video).
